## What's new?

Other posts in this category: [What's new]({tag}whatsnew)

### General

- RC_INFO
    - We had discussions in the past about info that we could provide that was not really a `Error`. After some extra feedback we did add the RC_INFO exit code to the tests, so that for example `xsos` output is also provided with citellus results so that it can be quickly checked also from the Web UI
- `overrides.json`
    - Allows to override fields in the results json with some values, for example to force updates of the titles, urls, etc in the results returned.
- `--anon`
    - Allows to anonymize results by removing contents of `err` and `out` fields in `citellus.json` so that it doesn't leak any information.
- `rhv-log-collector-analizer-live` support.
    - Citellus now does report on `live` executions the information reported from `rhv-log-collector-analizer-live --json` thanks to the great work done by Douglas Landgraf.
