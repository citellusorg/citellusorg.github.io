&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="We're 3 year old" src="https://citellusorg.github.io/blog/2020/06/11/3year-anniversary/images/3year.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citellus has been now around for three&amp;nbsp;years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 11th 2017 I have created this project for automating manual checks that I had to perform over and over again. It was very simple shell script that iterated over directories and executed shell scripts in&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, friends, colleagues started to use the program as well and provided feedback. We have reached out for help to one of our colleague Lars and asked if he had any ideas he could share with us to improve the&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have realized that current form of the program is very limiting and we wanted to&amp;nbsp;improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pablo has created a completely new framework in python that was based on the same idea, but he identified the problems with the current and addressed&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were lots of improvements, especially in execution of the scripts, we started with sequential run of the scripts and moved to parallel using&amp;nbsp;python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while our colleagues from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; have noticed the program with the new improvements, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t great user experience to read the output from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, especially as the number of plugins has grown to several&amp;nbsp;hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Vallee Delisle, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; created a dashboard that allowed to read the reports of the rules in the browser and greatly improved&amp;nbsp;usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pablo continued working on the framework and forever improving it and adding more features, one of the big ones was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.A.G.U.I.&lt;/span&gt; that stands for Multiple Analysis Generic Unifier and Interpreter that allowed running Citellus on top of cluster of multiple&amp;nbsp;nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while these two were separated programs, but we realised that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.A.G.U.I.&lt;/span&gt; brought benefits into Citellus and they both merged under&amp;nbsp;Citellus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spent probably a thousand of hours or more of our free time that we have dedicated into writing this program and some of the internal rules or&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this time we have had contributors that came and went, and some are still contributing to the project. I would like to shout out to Mikel and his contribution and his&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing with this project is that even after three years, Citellus is still&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period we&amp;#8217;ve enhanced Citellus to be integrated as described in the &lt;a href="https://citellusorg.github.io/blog/tag/whatsnew/"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s new&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday&amp;nbsp;Citellus!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robin Černín</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:55:38 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:citellusorg.github.io,2020-06-11:/blog/2020/06/11/3year-anniversary/</guid><category>blog</category><category>citellus</category><category>magui</category></item></channel></rss>
